                            <h4>Born and raised in south Detroit, Son of a Librarian and a Millwright, I found my way to the world wide web through the Personal Home Page. Prior to Web Development I started out in Mechanical Engineering eventually having a career in technical sales. After a while I felt it was time to start my own business so I jumped both feet in to starting a music site to aggregate and promote artists. Somewhere along the way I managed to learn a thing or two about web programming, the development process, SEO, marketing, copywrite, analytics etc. Of course I had help from various hired coaches but I ended up learning a thing or two. After I felt my own projects have ran there course I thought it might be a good idea to get some certification from BCIT for my line of work. Now I can be found at my desk plugging away at whatever project I am working on happy that I am not doing something else. </h4>
